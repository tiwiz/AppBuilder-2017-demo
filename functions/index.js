Good programmers write code that humans can understand.\u201D \u2014 Martin Fowler\\nThose are very good points when it comes to code, but what about pure data.\\nData is transferred between applications, stored for persistence, or represents configuration of an application. Does it still has to be human readable?\\nIn this talk I will present a few binary serialisation formats and we will examine what they bring to the table compared to human readable formats.\"\r\n}, {\r\n\t\"Name\": [\"Michael Guntli\"],\r\n\t\"Title\": \"Building an industrial device based on Android\",\r\n\t\"Description\": \"Join our journey!

How can we avoid frequent garbage collections? How can we offload as much as possible from the UI thread?\\nThe key concepts of the chosen application architecture will be discussed in detail:\\n- data flow & event driven design\\n- simple concurrency with actor model\\n- performance aware programming in Android\\n- type safe units and quantity with Java generics\\n- lockless & heapless queue for single producer \/ single consumer\\n- real-time data visualization of sensors with 200Hz sampling rate\"\r\n}, {\r\n\t\"Name\": [\"Dennis Pilarinos\"],\r\n\t\"Title\": \"Putting together the best CI workflow for mobile apps\",\r\n\t\"Description\": \"A developer\'s time is valuable. Ideally, it should be spent crafting an application that their users will love -  not focused on the tedious tasks involved in setting up and maintaining infrastructure. Two years ago, in the process of building an iOS app, a couple of friends realized that they were spending more time fighting with their build and deployment system than actually building their app. They put that iOS project on hold to try and build a better CI \/ CD platform for mobile developers.\\nToday, buddybuild provides the platform that thousands of mobile teams use to build apps that their users love. Its continuous integration, continuous delivery and user insight platform streamlines the process of building mobile apps. It also eliminates the friction development teams often face when involving their end users as part of their development workflow.\\nThis talk will dive into what\'s involved in designing, building, scaling and operating one of the most popular CI\/CD platforms for mobile developers. We\'ll also share some the best practices and trends we\'ve gathered in the process.\\nAfter this talk, the audience will be equipped with of a set of best practices to improve their mobile development, and some fun stories of building and operating a high scale, highly available distributed build system.\"\r\n}, {\r\n\t\"Name\": [\"Wajdi Ben Rabah\"],\r\n\t\"Title\": \"Interactions in parallel worlds with android\",\r\n\t\"Description\": \"The program of my talk consists on presenting the two alternatives realities based on Android: Virtual reality, and augmented reality.\\nNext, I would like to present the different technologies that allow us to develop a parallel experience.\\nThen, I would like to present in my slides the possible interactions for these two realities based on the motor Unity3D and Android.\\nFinally I would like to organize a code session in order to concretize the theoretical information that was quoted in the slides.\\nThank you.\"\r\n}, {\r\n\t\"Name\": [\"Anastasiia Voitova\"],\r\n\t\"Title\": \"Keys from the castle: ancient art of managing keys and trust\",\r\n\t\"Description\": \"We will talk about building trust.

We will talk about what should you trust, how to establish and verify trust, how to share trustedly among different users. We will discuss technical aspects: key exchange, key trust, key derivation, channel trust, multi-factor authentications. I will try to make the audience understand how this huge universe of tools and algorithms serves just one purpose: letting the right guys in, keeping the wrong guys outside our magical castle.

It was developed in 2012 at Facebook, and has powered Facebook\'s main iOS and Android apps for the last five years. After being open sourced in 2015, it is now being used by an increasing number of well known companies.\\nAn important benefit over REST is that it allows clients to ask for the exact data they need, without the server sending extraneous results or having to perform extra roundtrips to fetch related objects. It also makes it possible for a single server endpoint to support multiple versions of your app, without explicit versioning of your API.\\nIn this talk, I will introduce GraphQL, discuss why it is such a great match for mobile development, and talk about our efforts to build an open source GraphQL client for iOS, written in Swift.\\nIn particular, I will explain how we take advantage of code generation and the GraphQL type system to enable static type safety from the server to the UI, complete with Xcode integration.\"\r\n}, {\r\n\t\"Name\": [\"Florina Muntenescu\"],\r\n\t\"Title\": \"MVVM - It\u2019s all in the (implementation) details\",\r\n\t\"Description\": \"At upday, we\u2019ve been successfully using the Model-View-ViewModel pattern together with RxJava for more than a year and half. After sharing with the community a very high level overview of what this pattern entails, we decided that it\u2019s time to go deeper in the implementation details.\\nI will present our way of handling Android classes and other 3rd party dependencies, and how we make sure that our code is as unit-testable as possible. I\u2019ll speak about our decision process on how to split classes, may they be Views, ViewModels or DataModels, and the benefits and drawbacks of these separations.\\nAny app beyond \u201DHello World\u201D will most likely have two things: multiple Activities\/Fragments, of which at least one will contain a ListView\/RecyclerView. I will show how we decided to implement the navigation between Views and how we test it.

Although I\'ve written plenty of Java and some Swift in my time, I now write native software for both iOS and Android using C#.\\nC# has had Reactive Extensions since 2009. Features such as Language Integrated Query (LINQ), and async\/await are not just nice to have, they change the way you think about writing software.  Come to this presentation to see what it was that made returning to C# after years of writing Java on Android feel like coming up for a breath of fresh air.  I\'ll share some of my favorite and most powerful C# features and demo how I use them to write native iOS and watchOS apps and reuse most of my non-UI code when writing for Android too.\\nYou won\'t leave this presentation a .NET convert but you will leave with an understanding of why C# is a joy to program in, both on Android and iOS.\\nThe sound of music?

So protocol-oriented in fact, that it has three distinct protocol implementations: Objective-C compatible protocols, Swift protocols and finally the topic of this talk: Protocols with associated types.\\nThey are a quite powerful and often allow for building better abstractions. First, we will compare them to other Swift features; next we will address the problems that appear when introducing associated types; then we will employ them to sprinkle reactive magic on UIKit; and finally we will look at several real world use cases from open source projects that leverage their power.\"\r\n}, {\r\n\t\"Name\": [\"Niels van Hoorn\"],\r\n\t\"Title\": \"Prototype Everything\",\r\n\t\"Description\": \"When building great products it\'s essential to design and test your interfaces before actually implementing them.
